    "# Environment reproducibility\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The issue of software or environment reproducibility can sometimes look like this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "   ```mermaid\n",
    "   flowchart LR\n",
    "    R[More reproducibility] <--> M[Middle ground];\n",
    "    M <--> D[More developer friendliness];\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This is not always the case. In many cases the lack of reproducibility can make development harder:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. What if you mess up your development environment? Can you recreate it?\n",
    "  2. What if you need to transfer your training code to another system? Does the move require huge amounts of effort or can you do it quickly?\n",
    "  3. What if your colleagues want to help with the project? Can they recreate it?\n",
    "  4. What if the reviewer of your paper asks you how can you reproduce the code?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Usually it is a good idea to keep reproducibility in mind throughout the developement and harden the requirements of reproducibility the closer you get to releasing the results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  So the actual flowcart looks something like this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    D[Start recording the environment while developing] --> C[Record changes to the environment while developing];\n",
    "    C --> R[Lock down versions towards releases];\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  When it comes to machine learning, there are multiple ways of recording your environments. This is because most likely you'll be using Python for development.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ## Environment specifications\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### requirements.txt\n",
    "  \n",
    "  PyPI (Python Package Index) provides huge number of Python packages. You'll commonly install these with `pip`. For PyPI you'll usually want to record requirements as [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### pyproject.toml\n",
    "  \n",
    "  When developing your own Python module you'll usually want to use [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/). It is a specification that specifies your module's naming, version and requirements.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### environment.yml\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `environment.yml` is a Conda specification. Conda is a packaging system originally developed by Anaconda Inc., but nowadays people often use `conda-forge` to install their conda packages. It is a massiv  e open source software repository that can install not only Python packages, but also libraries and other programs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ## Other tools for creating reproducible environments\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### Apptainer / singularity\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Apptainer (originally called singularity) is a tool for creating and running containers on shared systems like HPC systems. CSC and LUMI utilize a tool called Tykky to create these containers, when you   want to install Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Docker\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Docker is a software for creating and launching containers. Nowadays most web applications run in containers. However, it usually requires root rights to run, so they are not common in shared system lik  e HPC clusters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Both Apptainer and Docker are very useful when you want to create an exact replica of your environment.\n",
